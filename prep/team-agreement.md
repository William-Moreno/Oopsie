## Team Agreement
### Conflict Plan 
- What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    - To be transparent with one another and first speak individually to each other. If the conflict is not resolved we will speak toegther as a group to address the conflict and try to come to a resolution. People not involved will act as mediarys. If conflict is still not resolved we will go to our instructor Jacob.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
    - With open and honest communication. Direct communication with the individual and group. We will all undertstand we are a team and not trying to hurt each others feelings but want everyone to contrinute.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
    - People not involved in the conflict will act as a mediary. If it is not possible to come to consensus and majority of group does not decide on resolution, we will imediately go to Jacob.

### Communication Plan 
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
    - We will communicate via Slack and be respectful of each other after scheduled work hours. We as a team typically monitor our Slacks after hours and on the weekend.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
    - As a team we will ensure everyones voice is heard on each decision we make. We will ask each other questions regarding what they think and how they feel about an idea or decision.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
    - By understanding we are a team and for our team to succeed we need to work together. Any team we have been a part of we all have wanted every voice to be heard and to feel comfortable in the environment they are in. We agree to build our team around that principle.

### Work Plan
- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
    - We will use a project management tool to identify tasks and assign them to our team members. Every day we will discuss what needs to be accomplised and what will be worked on by each member.
- What project management tool will be used?
    - We are going to utilize Trello as our project management tool to create tasks that need to be accomplished and assign a majority of the tasks to different team members.

### Git Process
- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
    - README, Lambda functions, UML, Database models, node files.
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
    - One person will create a repository and add the additional members as collaborators.
- What is your Git flow?
    - Each team member will work on their own branch for a feature and these branches will be merged into a dev branch upon review.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    - How many people must review a PR?
        - Two people other than the person who submitted the PR will review.
    - Who merges PRs?
        - Any team member that is available after PR review.
    - How often will you merge?
        - We will merge to dev branch every day. In the morning during our standup we will decide whether we need to merge and pull. At the end of the day we will decide if we need to merge and pull. At lunch we will also decide if we need to merge and pull. We will merge to main twice: once in the middle of the week to make sure processes are working and once at the completion of our project.
    - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
        - We will communicate amongst ourselves between the hours of 9-5 if anything needs to be merged and pulled. At the least once in the morning and once at the end of the day.
